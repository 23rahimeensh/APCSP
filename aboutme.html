    	My (unfortunate) name is Rahimeen. Some may call me a fan of the well acclaimed, A Series of Unfortunate Events, but I would say that they are a fan of me. Apart from relentlessly reading and encountering miserable experiences, wordle has proven to be a friend. Wordle, Framed, Waffle, Worldle, Citydle, Duotrigordle, and more daily games fill my time. Additionally, I play soccer and golf and occassionally paint and draw. All of this is done within California, more specifically, in PHS. I live with my parents (unlike the Baudelaires) and my two younger brothers (much like the Baudelaires). I was born in New York (we then moved to LA, Georgia, and are now here and have been for approximately seven years). Thank you for your intrest!
