      Well, since you're still here, might as well learn some more about me and my accomplishments.

    As I alluded to before, I like art so I've been working on my portfolio which I will eventually submit to the well renowned College Board. This specific image depicts me drawing my rendition of my beautiful violin. I was doing a graphite drawing on a flat canvas. I chose not to add color in order to highlight the shadows cast on the violin. I'm still trying to figure out what my overall concept is but as of right now, it'll be a "flipped world" theme so for this piece in particular, the shadows will come from all sides in various different sizes to bring out the "unconventional" aspect of this newly created world.

      The picture above is (surprise!) me once again. My golf teammates and I have had a few apperances in the also well renowned Piedmont Exedra. They reported the following, "Piedmont swept Berkeley, Arroyo, and Castro Valley" (this means the Highlanders won :) ).
      My coach said, "“They’re growing, with varsity golf, varsity anything, your best players are usually coming into the sport with experience. More than half of the league is getting kids who are just getting a club into their hands. I think they’re growing quickly". This would be quite a true statement for me since I "just got a club in my hand" the summer before freshman year and having been playing on the team since then.
